# Declarative Syntax Basics

## Setup to use Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor

**Note**: You need to have a Github personal access token ([Github-Personal-Access-Token.md](Github-Personal-Access-Token.md)) before proceeding.

We will setup the [Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/blueocean/pipeline-editor/) so we can use the visual editor for many of following exercises:

1. If not already in Blue Ocean, click on the **Teams** or **Open Blue Ocean** link in the left side navigation bar
2. Click on the **Create a new Pipeline** button (if you have already created a Pipeline, you will need to click the **New Pipeline** button in the upper right) <p><img src="img/1-0-create-a-new-pipeline.png" width=300/>
3. Click on one of the options in the **Where do you store your code?** section (**GitHub** for this course) <p><img src="img/1-0-select-scm.png" width=300/>
4. Enter your **GitHub token** (your GitHub Personal Access Token)
5. Next, select your GitHub user account (NOTE: Be sure to select the GitHub Organization where you created the empty repository for this workshop. The repository should not have an existing Jenkinsfile.) <p><img src="img/1-0-select-github-org.png" width=300/>
6. Under **Choose a repository** select the repository you created during setup and then click the **Create Pipeline** button <p><img src="img/1-0-choose-repo-create-pipeline.png" width=420/>

Next, the Blue Ocean editor will open - if the editor does not load after a minute or so, refresh your browser. 

## Basic Declarative Syntax Structure

In this exercise we will create a simple Declarative Pipeline using the Blue Ocen Pipeline editor.

Declarative Pipelines must be enclosed within a `pipeline` block and must contain a top-level `agent` declaration, and then contains exactly one `stages` block. The `stages` block must have at least one `stage` block but can have an unlimited number of additional stages. Each `stage` block must have exactly one `steps` block. The Blue Ocean editor takes care of much of this for you but we will need to add a `stage` and `steps`.

Using the Blue Ocean Pipeline editor we setup in the previous exercise, do the following:

1. You should see the **You don't have any branches that contain a Jenkinsfile** dialog, click on the **Create Pipeline** button (NOTE: If you already had a `Jenkinsfile` in your repository then the editor should open straight-away) <p><img src="img/1-1-create-pipeline-no-jenkinsfile.png" width=300/>
2. Click on the **+** icon next to the pipeline's **Start** node to add a `stage` <p><img src="img/1-basic-syntax-add-stage.png" width=400/>
3. Click into **Name your stage** and type in the text 'Say Hello'
4. Click on the **+ Add step** button <p><img src="img/1-basic-syntax-add-step.png" width=400/>
5. Click on the **Print Message** step and type in ***Hello World!*** as the **Message**
6. Click on the **<-** (arrow) next to the **'Say Hello / Print Message'** text to add another step <p><img src="img/1-1-print-message-then-add-step.png" width=300/>
7. Click on the **+ Add step** button
8. Click on the **Shell Script** step and enter `java -version` into the text area
9. Press the key combination `CTRL + S` to open the Blue Ocean free-form editor and you should see a Pipeline similar to the one below **(click anywhere outside the editor to close it)**:

```
pipeline {
   agent any
   stages {
      stage('Say Hello') {
         steps {
            echo 'Hello World!'   
            sh 'java -version'
         }
      }
   }
}
```

10. Click the **Save** button <p><img src="img/1-1-shell-step-save.png" width=350/>
11. Enter a commit message into the **Save Pipeline** pop up and click **Save & Run** <p><img src="img/1-basic-syntax-save-run.png" width=350/>

>Your Pipeline is actually being committed and pushed to your GitHub repository, and will run right away.

12. Click on your Pipeline to see the `steps` execute. <p><img src="img/1-1-click-to-see-pipeline-run.png" width=400/>
13. Expand the **'java -version — Shell Script' `step` and you should see the following: <p><img src="img/1-1-java-version-step-expanded.png" width=420/>
  
>NOTE: You may have noticed that your Pipeline GitHub repository is being cloned even though you didn't specify that in your Jenkinsfile. Declarative Pipeline checks out source code by default.

## Agent Labels

In this exercise we will update the pipeline we created in the previous exercise to use a specific `agent` using the `label` syntax. As you saw from the build logs of the previous exercise, the Java version of the `agent any` was 8. We want to update our pipeline to use a version 9 JDK by replacing the `any` parameter with a `label` declaration:

1. Click on the **pencil** icon in the top right to edit your Pipeline <p><img src="img/1-2-click-pencil.png" width=520/>
2. Use the key combination `CTRL + S` to open up the free-form editor
>NOTE: You could use the visual editor but it doesn't support the short syntax for adding a label and requires you to add a `node` block and then apply a `label`
3. Replace the `agent any` declaration with the following `agent` declaration:

>NOTE: Don't worry about formatting too much as the Blue Ocean editor will reformat your Jenkinsfile before it is committed to your repository

```
  agent {
    label 'jdk9'
  }
```

4. Click the **Update** button
5. Click the **Save** button, enter a commit message into the **Save Pipeline** pop up and click **Save & Run**. 

You should see the following output for the `sh` step after your Pipeline runs:

```
openjdk version "9.0.4"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 9.0.4+12-Debian-4)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 9.0.4+12-Debian-4, mixed mode)
```

In addition to `any` and `label` you may also specify `none` and no global agent will be allocated for the entire Pipeline run and each `stage` section will need to contain its own `agent` section.

6. Now change the value of the `label` to **default**

```
   agent {
     label 'jdk8'
   }
```

7. Click the **Save** button, enter a commit message into the **Save Pipeline** pop up and click **Save & Run**. 

You should see the following output for the `sh` step after your updated Pipeline runs:

```
openjdk version "1.8.0_151"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 3.6.0) (Alpine 8.151.12-r0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)
```

Your Pipeline should look like the following before you move onto the next exercise:

```
pipeline {
   agent { label 'jdk8' }
   stages {
      stage('Say Hello') {
         steps {
            echo 'Hello World!'   
            sh 'java -version'
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## Environment Directive

For this exercise we are going to update our pipeline to demonstrate how to use the `environment` directive to set and use environment variables. We will also see how this directive supports a special helper method `credentials()` that allows access to pre-defined Jenkins Credentials based on their id.

### Simple Environment Variables

1. At the top of the pipeline insert the following code between the `agent` and `stages` blocks:  

```
   environment {
      MY_NAME = 'Mary'
   }
```

2. Then update the `echo 'Hello World!'` line to read `echo "Hello ${MY_NAME}!"`
>Notice the change from `''` to `""`.  Using double quotes will trigger extrapolation of environment variables.
3. Click the **Update** button
4. Click the **Save** button, enter a commit message into the **Save Pipeline** pop up and click **Save & Run**.
5. Click on your Pipeline to see the `steps` execute.

>NOTE: The Blue Ocean Editor will move global `environment` blocks after stages. The location does not matter as long as it is outside the `stages` block.

### Credentials

We can also use environmental variables to import credentials.

1. Add the following line to our `environment` block:

```TEST_USER = credentials('test-user')```

>NOTE: For Credentials which are of type "Standard username and password", the environment variable specified will be set to username:password and two additional environment variables will automatically be defined: `MYVARNAME_USR` and `MYVARNAME_PSW` respectively.
2. Add the following ```echo``` steps within the ```steps``` of the **Say Hello** ```stage```:

```
            echo "${TEST_USER_USR}"
            echo "${TEST_USER_PSW}"
```

3. Click the **Update** button
4. Click the **Save** button, enter a commit message into the **Save Pipeline** pop up and click **Save & Run**.  
5. Click on your Pipeline to see the `steps` execute. Look at the console output and make note of the fact that the credential user name and password are masked when output via the `echo` command.

## Parameters

In this exercise we will update our pipeline to accept external input in the form of a Jenkins job parameter.

1. Update your pipeline by inserting the following  after the ```environment``` block:

```
   parameters {
      string(name: 'Name', defaultValue: 'whoever you are', 
	     description: 'Who should I say hi to?')
   }
```

2. Update the ```echo "Hello ${MY_NAME}!'``` line to read ```echo "Hello ${params.Name}!"```
3. Click the **Save** button, enter a commit message into the **Save Pipeline** pop up and click **Save & Run**. 
>NOTE: The option to ***Build with parameters*** will not be available until you run your job at least once as parameters are Jenkins job properties that must be set in Jenkins. Using `parameters` in your Jenkinsfile updates the Jenking job configuration after the first run. 
4. Run the pipeline again by returning to the Blue Ocean activity view and then clicking on the **Branches** tab top right and then click the run button.<p><img src="img/1-param-run.png" width=520/>
5. After clicking the run button an **Input required** dialog will appear with the **Name** paramter. Replace **whoever you are** with your name and click the **Run** button.<p><img src="img/1-param-input-required.png" width=480/>
6. Now your top **Print Message** step should reflect your parameter value similar to this for a value of ***Beedemo Dev***: <p><img src="img/1-param-echo.png" width=550/>

## Next Exercises
You may proceed onto **[Declarative Advanced Syntax](./Exercise-02.md)** once your instructor tells you to.

Before you proceed you may want to check that your Pipeline looks like the following:

```
pipeline {
  agent {
    label 'jdk8'
  }
  stages {
    stage('Say Hello') {
      steps {
        echo "Hello ${params.Name}!"
        sh 'java -version'
        echo "${TEST_USER_USR}"
        echo "${TEST_USER_PSW}"
      }
    }
  }
  environment {
    MY_NAME = 'Mary'
    TEST_USER = credentials('test-user')
  }
  parameters {
    string(name: 'Name', defaultValue: 'whoever you are', description: 'Who should I say hi to?')
  }
}
```
